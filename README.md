MH-RL for VRP Review

About This Repository: MH-RL-for-VRP_Review

This repository contains the data and resources used in our comprehensive review of methods combining Metaheuristics (MH) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) to solve the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP).
The VRP is one of the most well-known and challenging logistics problems. It involves planning the best routes for a fleet of vehicles to deliver goods to customers while meeting various constraints like vehicle capacity. Over the years, researchers have tackled this problem using a variety of methods, including exact algorithms, heuristics, metaheuristics, and machine learning techniques.

Our study takes a closer look at the relatively new area of combining metaheuristics with reinforcement learning. These hybrid approaches are gaining attention for their ability to leverage the strengths of both methods, resulting in more efficient and effective solutions.

Whatâ€™s Inside This repository includes:
- A comprehensive review of advanced techniques used to solve the VRP.
- A focus on hybrid approaches that combine metaheuristics and reinforcement learning.
- A breakdown of studies into three distinct categories for easier understanding.
- Insights into emerging trends, current challenges, and potential research directions.

Why This Matters:
Our goal with this review is to provide a clear and thorough understanding of how metaheuristics and reinforcement learning can be combined to tackle the VRP. By identifying key challenges and opportunities, we hope to inspire further research in this exciting and growing field.
